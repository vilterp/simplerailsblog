- controller
  - only allow edit/create/comment when logged in!
  - redirect to Post#show on post creation
- layout
  - put new post link at top of page
  - put Edit | Destroy links after post, before comments header
- Edit screen
  - ajax preview before save
  - ajax diff before post save?
  - make the textarea wider
  - ajax draft saves, GMail style?
- optimization/db stuff
  - diffs take too long to render -- compute on save, put in db?
  - deleting a post breaks the event queue cuz it looks for a post that's not there
    - store all attributes in post table? Only some attrs on per-model basis?
- comments
  - Reddit-style nested comments would be cool, or Trac-style "followup" links, or both
  - so would Ajax comments
  - ajax preview?
  - ajax submission? Learn some RJS...
